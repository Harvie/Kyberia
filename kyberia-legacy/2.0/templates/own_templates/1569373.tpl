So crucify the ego before it's far too late<br>
To leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical<br>
And you will come to find that we are all one mind<br>
Capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable<br>
Just let the light touch you and let the words spill thorough<br>
Just let them pass right through, bringing out our hope and reason.<br>
<br><br><br>
before we pine away
