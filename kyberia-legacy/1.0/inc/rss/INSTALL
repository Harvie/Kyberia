REQUIREMENTS

	MapieRSS requires a recent PHP 4+ (developed with 4.2.0)
	with xml (expat) support
	
INSTALLATION

	* add the files to your include path (see MAGPIE_DIR for shared hosts)
	* create a cache directory that your webserver can write to
	  (Mapie will try to create one for you, but it often fails)
	* read through the constants at the top of rss_fetch.inc
	  see if there is anything you want to override (the defaults should
	  be pretty good)
